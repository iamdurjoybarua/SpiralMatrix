# Spiral Matrix Traversal (Java)

This Java program prints the elements of a 2D array in spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving inwards.

## Overview

The `SpiralMatrix` class contains a method `printSpiral(int[][] matrix)` that takes a 2D integer array as input and prints its elements in spiral order.

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of this method with a sample 2D array.

## Features

-   Handles null or empty matrices, returning without any output in such cases.
-   Traverses the matrix in a spiral pattern, moving right, down, left, and up in a loop.
-   Prints the elements with spaces between them.
-   Prints a newline character after the spiral traversal is complete.
-   Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.
